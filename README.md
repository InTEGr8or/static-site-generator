A basic static site generator written in Python for learning purposes.

This simple static generator is exactly what I've been looking for for a while and started writing before finding NQCM's implementation.

There should be some special type of static site which is produced by simply converting .md or .asciidoc or other ASCII markdown files to HTML, and translating folder navigation into website navigation.

Once I get this working I will attempt a simple markdown -> bootstrap integration, or see if there is one already available, for adding a little control for columns.
